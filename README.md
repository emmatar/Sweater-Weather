# Sweater-Weather
A weather application that displays the forecast AND *weather* or not to wear a sweater or not (im so sorry).


## Description

Welcome to <span style="color:#9BB8CD">Sweater Weather</span>! An application set to inform users on current weather details, dependent on their user input. 

<span style="color:#9BB8CD">Sweater Weather</span> pulls data from OpenWeatherAPI to retreive accurate weather data regarding the User's "city" input. Not only will you get the current timed weather data, but also a five day forecast projection for the city searched!

WAIT, THERES MORE!!

To differentiate from the intense weather dashboard competition, this application will display a petite sweater icon, on the current weather, if the temperature is the ideal for *<span style="color:#9BB8CD">Sweater Weather</span>* (55°F-65°F).

*Check "Usage" for more information on how to use The Daily Scheduler*

## Usage

Sweater Weather was designed to be simple yet efficient. The layout relfects this by being sectioned off into three key areas: Search, Today's Weather, and 5-Day Forecast. 

Search: 
On the left side of the User's screen, an input box diplays for the user to type any city they wish to see weather data for. Text-input a city and click the little blue search button for the city's weather info! If the data or the city can be successfully retrieved, the users input will save and a "Search History" will display below the search box. Each input, displayed in the Search History section, can be clicked on, and when they are selected, the application will display the current weather for that *clicked* city input.

Today's Weather: 
After the User enters a city name and clicks the search button, two sections will appear. At the top of the page, and in a single cube of info, Todays Weather will display the User's desired city, todays date, short description, temperature, wind speed, and humidity.

5-Day Forecast:
Towards the bottom half of the page, a 5-day forecast will display weather data for each day of the week in a text section itself. 

Lastly, and as mentioned above, <span style="color:#9BB8CD">Sweater Weather</span> offers its little delight by letting the user know if the day is truly suited for a nice-BIG-*comfy*-<span style="color:#9BB8CD">sweater.</span>

Hoping you a joyous experience, Cheers!
